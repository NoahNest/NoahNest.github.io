            <p>Until just about a year ago, it was hiding in plain sight. It is always there, the same corner, same time (2:00 pm to 4:00 am), cloistered between the elementary school and the library. I must have passed its boxy figure with its bright sign saying, “Taco Pollo Loco” hundreds of times over the years when I would walk to the subway or get a bite to eat, yet it was seemingly shrouded to the human eye by the oak trees looming above it. For whatever reason, I barely knew of its existence even though it was only two blocks away from my house.</p>
      
            <p>I first went there seemingly by luck. I was coming home late at night after I hung out with a couple of my friends. Tired and hungry, I strolled back home through closed restaurants and burnt-out street lamps. But as I turned the corner, I saw the taco truck’s fluorescent sign lighting up the block, and I felt the comforting smells of the tacos beckoning me like a cartoon character getting lifted up by the smell of pie.</p> 
        
            <p>When I walked towards the truck, the sounds of Mexican music that echoed from it created a spark of joy against the silent, dark night. When I looked at the menu, I was taken back by the wide variety of tacos ranging from safe choices like chicken and pork to more adventurous bull’s head and pork tongue ones.</p>
	    
	        <p>Eager for nourishment, I decided to order a few pork tacos and sat on a bench and waited. After a couple of minutes, I got up to get the tacos and brought them over to the bench, feeling their warmth emanating from their container. I opened the white plastic container to find two pork tacos that created a mouthwatering aroma of meat and spices. I eagerly brought the taco to my mouth and took a massive bite. The taco was savory and balanced with the lime, onions, pineapple, and pork all mixing together in perfection. With juices spilling down my chin I scarfed both of them down with glee and satisfaction.</p>
        
            <p>After that initial experience, the taco truck cemented itself as part of my life. I would go there after a long day of school for a quick snack or take my friends there to share it with them. When I would walk past it, I would no longer ignore its existence, but cherish the joy it brings to me.</p>
        
            <p>Although the taco truck is important to me, it is not the only place I have formed a close connection with. Throughout my years in New York, I have found many other places special to me: an underground pool ball, a Tibetan restaurant that hangs over the subway track, and an outdoor barbeque place that overwhelms the horrid aroma of the Gowanus Canal with the smoking of brisket and turkey; these are all places that have made their mark on me by inducing wonder and bringing me delectable flavors.</p>
       
            <p>But this is not just something I can experience. You can find your own taco truck. If you explore New York and go beyond the instagramable picnics at Central Park, the congestion Times Square, and the frivolous Soho shops that will bring in hoards of people desperate to buy t-shirts that will cost them an arm and a leg you’ll get to the real NY. That is where you will find what is truly personal and special to you. That is when you find your hidden gems.</p>
